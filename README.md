# ðŸ©º Indian Liver Dataset: EDA & ML Insights

## ðŸ“Š Overview
This project explores the **Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)**, which contains demographic and biochemical features of patients.  
The dataset is widely used for **liver disease prediction and medical ML research**.

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **ML preparation**, we uncover:
- Age and gender distribution of patients
- Biochemical indicators linked to liver health
- Correlations between bilirubin, proteins, and enzyme levels
- Predictive potential of features for **liver disease classification**

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Features
- **age** â€“ Patient age  
- **gender** â€“ Male/Female  
- **tot_bilirubin** â€“ Total bilirubin  
- **direct_bilirubin** â€“ Direct bilirubin  
- **tot_proteins** â€“ Total proteins  
- **albumin** â€“ Albumin levels  
- **ag_ratio** â€“ Albumin/Globulin ratio  
- **sgpt** â€“ Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase  
- **sgot** â€“ Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase  
- **alkphos** â€“ Alkaline phosphotase

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights Summary
- Majority of patients are **male**, with higher liver enzyme abnormalities observed.  
- Elevated **bilirubin** and **alkaline phosphatase** levels are strongly correlated with liver complications.  
- **Albumin/Globulin ratio (A/G ratio)** emerges as an important biomarker.  
- Dataset patterns highlight strong potential for **ML models** to classify liver disease presence.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Train ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC curves  
- Build a baseline health risk prediction pipeline
